;; CHALLENGE 2: Write a function to build a tree of all possible games. Explain
;; why or why not it uses content-zipper (above).

;; CHALLENGE 3: Is it possible to rewrite build-tree so that it's significantly
;; more efficient in time and/or space? If so, what strategies do you see for
;; that? Implement one.

;; CHALLENGE 4: write code to answer some of the following questions:
;; 1. What percentage of 100000 random games have no win?
;; 2. Given a partial game in a particular state, which player if any has
;;   a guaranteed win if they play optimally?
;; 3. Under what conditions is player 2 (O) guaranteed a win?
;; 4. Can X get a win if they blow 1st move?
